## Overview

The primary objective of this notebook is to analyze a dataset, clean and preprocess the data, and fit a linear regression model to uncover relationships between variables. Key stages include:

1. Importing libraries and dataset.
2. Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Data preprocessing and feature selection.
4. Building and evaluating a linear regression model.
5. Interpreting the results.

## Features

### Data Exploration:
- Summary statistics and visualizations.
- Identification of key variables.

### Data Cleaning:
- Dropping unnecessary columns.
- Handling missing or anomalous data.

### Modeling:
- Splitting data into training and testing sets.
- Standardizing features.
- Fitting a linear regression model using statsmodels.

### Evaluation:
- Assessing model performance using metrics like R-squared.
- Identifying multicollinearity with Variance Inflation Factors (VIF).

## Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries**: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodels.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression-assignment.git
